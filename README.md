 Analysis of nosocomial COVID data in England

This repository contains code needed to reproduce the analysis in the manuscript "The burden and dynamics of hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 in England"
For access to data sources please see documentation within the manuscript.

Note: we will add synthetic data based on saturated models to allow the analysis to be replicated approximately, and when we have permission to share data that will be shared here. We will also add some wrapper code to copy over synethic data and run all functions.

To run the code copy all files to a working directory and run these files in turn (this will require installing packages if they are not already installeded)
